<h1 style="color: orange;">Thoughts about Life</h1>
<p style="color: blue;">(Smiles).</p>
<p style="color: green;">It would be difficult to say what I think about because I think about different things at different times. But nevertheless, here are some things:</p>
<p style="color: orange;">Is life a journey or a war?</p>
<p style="color: orange;">Why people are the way they are?</p>
<p style="color: orange;">If death is certain, can I go loco?</p>
<p style="color: orange;">Why death exists and so many of us fear it?</p>
<p style="color: orange;">When I wil be old what will matter the most?</p> 
<p style="color: orange;">Is it true that our interpretation of reality influences the way we behave, therefore our lifestyle and results?</p> 
<p style="color: orange;">What truly matters?</p>
<p style="color: orange;">Who would visit me at my funeral?</p>
<p style="color: orange;">Is love truly one of the few things that matter most?</p>
<p style="color: orange;">What would be utopian society like? Do we have it now?</p> 
<p style="color: orange;">Are humans inherently good or bad? Maybe neither?</p>
<p style="color: orange;">Why humans have such brains and other life forms do not have?</p> 
<p style="color: orange;">Why do we search for meaning and animals do not? Do they?</p> 
<p style="color: orange;">What each one of us should experience while being alive?</p>
<p style="color: orange;">Is being self-centered bad? What is bad by the way?</p>
<p style="color: orange;">We are not taught how to live well and how to beat the fear of the unknown. Why is that?</p>
<p style="color: orange;">Why do we talk too little about the things that matter? Why do we talk too little about old age, sickness and death?</p>
<p style="color: green;">
Actually, I made it a habit to replay conversations, to worry about things in life, to worry about 'what ifs' of life, and to do this every time.</p>
<p style="color: green;">
It is just a habit I need to break. I need to become aware of how much mind's space and energy I needlessly spending on thinking this way. I must let things just how it should be.</p>
